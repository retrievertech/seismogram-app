        SKATE (Seismogram Kit for Automatic Trace Extraction) is a
        web-based software tool for the digitization of seismic traces
        in historic analog seismograms. This work was performed under
        DOE contract DE-SC0008219.

        Retriever Technology has scanned approximately 150,000 WWSSN
        images under several contracts, including but not limited to
        USGS award G09PC00116, G09PD02064, and G10PD02236.

        Most of these seismograms are available for viewing on this
        website. A significant subset has been processed and is ready
        for editing and timeseries assignment. Refer to the
